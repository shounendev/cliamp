# Themes

cliamp includes 21 color themes that pass contrast checks. You can add custom themes with TOML files.

Press `t` during playback to open the theme picker. Use `↑`/`↓` to navigate and preview each theme. Press `Enter` to select it or `Esc` to cancel.

cliamp saves your selection and restores it at the next start.

## Built-in themes

ayu-mirage-dark, catppuccin, catppuccin-latte, dracula, ember, ethereal, everforest, flexoki-light, gruvbox, hackerman, kanagawa, matte-black, miasma, neon-blade-runner, nord, osaka-jade, ristretto, rose-pine, tokyo-night, vantablack, winamp

## Creating a custom theme

Create a `.toml` file in `~/.config/cliamp/themes/`:

```
mkdir -p ~/.config/cliamp/themes
```

Each file needs all six foreground colors as `#RRGGBB` hex values. Add `bg` to
set a background. Omit it to keep the terminal background. cliamp ignores
incomplete or malformed custom themes. The file name without `.toml` is the
theme name.

### Example: `~/.config/cliamp/themes/solarized.toml`

```toml
bg = "#002b36"
accent = "#268bd2"
bright_fg = "#eee8d5"
fg = "#839496"
green = "#859900"
yellow = "#b58900"
red = "#dc322f"
```

Press `t` to show the theme in the list immediately.

### Color reference

| Key         | Color use                                   |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `bg`        | Optional application background             |
| `accent`    | Title, track name, seek bar, selected items, playing track, volume bar, visualizer base |
| `bright_fg` | Primary text, time display, visualizer peak |
| `fg`        | Muted text, help bar, inactive elements     |
| `green`     | Playing status and success messages         |
| `yellow`    | Warnings                                    |
| `red`       | Errors                                      |

Visualizers draw a three-step gradient from `accent` at the base, through an
even mix of `accent` and `bright_fg`, to `bright_fg` at the peak. The terminal
default theme keeps the classic green, yellow, and red gradient.

All values are six-digit hex strings, for example `"#ff5733"`. Help-key pill
text switches between black and white for readable contrast.

Important UI states also use stable text markers: `>`, `Q`, `★`, `!`, `WARN:`,
and `ERR:`. These markers keep state and feedback distinct in monochrome
terminals.

## Overriding a built-in theme

If a custom file has the same name as a built-in theme, the custom file takes
priority. For example, `~/.config/cliamp/themes/catppuccin.toml` replaces the
built-in catppuccin theme.

## Setting a default theme

Add a `theme` line to `~/.config/cliamp/config.toml`:

```toml
theme = "catppuccin"
```

Use the file name without `.toml`. Leave the value empty or omit it to use
terminal default colors.
